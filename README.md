## Reflections

Working with and learning react was a challenge.  This was my first app I've built,
and it's exciting to know that I now have the knowledge to do so. 
This project was the second project that I've used SASS for, 
and I definitely have a better grasp on it this time around, and definitely prefer
it over regular css. I'm also very glad I learned to use Webpack to build, and how 
to properly construct a re-usable webpack config file.
